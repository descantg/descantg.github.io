    <p1>My final project is a collection of all my previous projects<br /><br /></p1>
    <p2>There are 6 different projects to choose from.<br /><br /></p2>
    <p3>The first is an infinite runner game where you run on top of buildings and try to get a high score. It was the first project I made.<a href="building.html">Building Game</a><br /><br /></p2>
    <p4>The second is an  interesting art  thing I made where the lines orbit around your mouse. I made it by accident when playing with particle systems and frogot to re-draw the background<a href="Line.html">Fancy Lines</a><br /><br /></p2>
    <p5>The next game is two player snake. If you're lonely you can can delete a line and play snake alone. Loser. <a href="Snake.html">Snake</a><br /><br /></p2>
    <p6>After that is the stealth game. It is by far the most complicated on I have madde so far. You need to sneek through a level without being found by the guards. It also has a plot but that really doesn't matter. Also it is my 'final' project. Please mark this one.<a href="Stealth.html">Stealth</a><br /><br /></p2>
    <p7>The next game is a two player top down shooter. The goal of the game is to find youself, find the other player, then shoot them. <a href="Top down.html">Top Down Shooter</a><br /><br /></p2>
    <p8>The other project is a two player Tron game. <a href="tron.html">Tron</a><br /></p2>
